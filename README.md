left-handed-keyboard
====================

I broke my primary wrist; I needed a way to use emacs without my right hand.

This repository contains the Arduino code and Xkb keyboard map
I created for typing with only my left hand on the left side of my keyboard.


Big thanks to [Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com) for getting me [started with Xkb](http://blog.xkcd.com/2007/08/14/mirrorboard-a-one-handed-keyboard-layout-for-the-lazy/)
